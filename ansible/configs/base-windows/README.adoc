== Overview

*base-windows* is a Base Architecture for simple infrastructure of a single Microsoft Windows System.

=== Cloud Support

* AWS via `cloud_provider: ec2`

=== Architecture

* Windows host (Defaults to Windows 2019 Server English Core Base)

=== Basic Architecture and Overview

This config uses a number of new roles, and patterns, that differ from older _Ansible Type_ configs:

* New role `bastion-base` - lighter and less crufty than older roles, basically does less
** Supports new packages list `agd_bastion_packages` simplifying bastion only packaging v `common_packages`
** New role `user-create-ansible-service-account`

* RedHat Enterprise Linux `bastion`

== Developers Notes

Tested and developed with:

* Developed on
** Ansible 2.14 - see sample_vars, coming to AgnosticD venvs soon, after optimizations (2023-02-28 tonykay@redhat.com)
* Initial, depreciated, development on Ansible `2.11`
** Venv `agnosticd-ansible-2.11-python-3.8`
** Deployed with `ansible-playbook` (`2.11` as stated above)
** i.e. at this time no work has been done to validate with `ansible-navigator`
** or execution environments though little difficulty (and some gains) are anticipated
* Makes fairly extensive use of software switches aka booleans etc
** Please continue this trend so everything can be turned on and off simply by vars
** `when: install_vscode_server | default(false) | bool`

NOTE: At this writing, March 2023, the AgnosticD `ec2` cloud_provider *no longer* appears to use a number of depreciated or obsolete tasks. See configs `requirements.yaml` to ensure correct collections e.g. `amazon.aws` Laptop developers in particular may need to resolve Collections via `export ANSIBLE_COLLECTIONS_PATH=...` See *LIfecycle Notes* below for implications and why `config` *currently* needs its own `lifecycle.yml`

=== Style etc.

This `config` attempts to offload virtually all its work into roles and as a general guideline the
configs playbooks (pre_, post etc) should primarily or even exclusively avoid embedding other tasks within the plays. IE these plays should try to limit themselves yo:

. `import_role` or `include_role`
. `set_fact`
.  `agnosticd_user_info`

Pretty much everything else should be a role, protected by a software switch `when: ... default(false) | bool`. It goes without saying these should all be FQCN e.g. `ansible.builtin.set_fact`

=== Makefile

An *optional* `Makefile` is provided as this self-documents how the config deploys from a laptop or similar. It is not an essential part of the process but is extremely useful, a simple `make` will list the functionality and modern shells should offer tab completion. Examples:

* `make deploy|destroy`
* `make ssh-bastion`

=== Development *TIPS*

* The `output_dir` inventory is *GOLD* and speeds up development:
** e.g. `ansible-playbook role-wrapping-playbook-to-test.yml -i /tmp/output_dir/inventory_post_software.yaml -e @~/secrets/secret-aws-ate-no-sandbox.yml`
* Use a virtualenv (venv) *For Now* EE support coming
* Consider using ANSIBLE_COLLECTIONS_PATH to *hide* more up to date collections you may have installed
** Can be an issue on laptop deployments e.g. you have _latest and greatest_ in`~/.ansible/collections`
** Example, assumes you are in repo root dir: `export ANSIBLE_COLLECTIONS_PATH=$(pwd)/collections` 

NOTE: In some places this config has started to introduce a `agd_` variable prefix e.g. `agd_install_common` instead of `install_common`. This is to avoid collisions and is arguably a superior practice.

==== Mac Developer Notes

Common Errors, issues

[source,sh]
----
Â fatal: [bastion.base-aap2-01.internal]: FAILED! => {"msg": "crypt.crypt not supported on Mac OS X/Darwin, install passlib python module. crypt.crypt not supported on Mac OS X/Darwin, install passlib python module"}
----

passlib error re crypt
Fix: python3 -m pip install passlib


Fix: If Python dep `PyGObject==3.42.2` fails to install then `brew install gobject-introspection` resolved it for tonykay@redhat.com

== Sample files

* A _typical_ secrets file:

[source,yaml]
----
---
#
# Set cloud provider here as these ties 100% to secrets
#

cloud_provider: ec2

#
# Sandbox creds 2022-07-20
#

aws_access_key_id:                              <YOUR-AWS-SANDBOX-KEY>
aws_secret_access_key:                          <YOUR-AWS-SECRET-ACCESS-SANDBOX-KEY>
subdomain_base_suffix:                          <subdomain from sandbox email, including leading `.`>

#
# Satellite Creds, use labsat-HA and dedicated activation key for isolation
#

repo_method:                                    satellite
set_repositories_satellite_ha:                  true
set_repositories_satellite_url:                 <YOUR-URL>
set_repositories_satellite_org:                 <YOUR-ORG>
set_repositories_satellite_activationkey:       <OBTAIN FROM YOUR ADMIN>

...

=== Totally Optional File 

Whilst developing I, Tony (tok@redhat.com) basically setup my develop environment like this:

. `workon agnosticd-ansible-2.11-python-3.8` # or however you manage venvs
. `source tok-env.sh` in the root directory of AgnosticD

* An example of my `tok-env.sh`:

[source,bash]
----
export ANSIBLE_COLLECTIONS_PATH=/Users/tok/repos/agnosticd/repo/agnosticd/collections
export ANSIBLE_LOG_PATH=/tmp/output_dir/ate-01
export ANSIBLE_CONFIG=tok-ansible.cfg

export MAKEFILE=$(pwd)/ansible/configs/ent-demo-ate-base/Makefile

# old legacy config
alias mk="make -f $MAKEFILE "
----

NOTE: The above is purely optional but should perhaps help others do laptop based deploys. Also after doing this you can simply `mk dep<TAB>` for example to do a deploy, or `mk ssh-b<TAB>` to ssh to a bastion

=== Common Errors and Mistakes

* Make sure you are using a supported venv and ansible version
